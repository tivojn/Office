#           DESIGN SYSTEM
# ══════════════════════════════════════

**Purpose:**
A reusable reference for selecting layout, format, and visual style when generating presentation or editorial content. Each style is defined as a self-contained option with standardized sections.

**Usage:**
When creating new content, specify the Style ID (e.g., "Use STYLE-01") to apply the corresponding design system across layout, typography, color, and graphic treatment.
